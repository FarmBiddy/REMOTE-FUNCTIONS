# Architecture

## Purpose

The Financial Service is a stateless financial calculation service.

For local workflow and **current implementation vs target architecture**, see `docs/development.md`.
Recorded decisions: `docs/decisions/`.

Its responsibility is to:
- validate financial inputs
- perform financial calculations
- return structured financial results
- expose calculation capabilities through an API

It is NOT responsible for:
- user authentication
- farm ownership
- Supabase access
- database persistence
- conversation state
- user sessions
- farm CRUD
- document ingestion

## System Boundary

The App Platform is the authoritative boundary for:
- user identity
- farm identity
- authorization
- Supabase/RLS access
- persistent financial models
- farm data aggregation

The Financial Service receives explicitly scoped financial inputs
from an authorized upstream service.

The Financial Service MUST NOT directly access Supabase.

## Authentication

User JWTs MUST NOT be forwarded to the Financial Service
for the purpose of accessing Supabase.

The Financial Service uses service-to-service authentication.

## State

The calculation engine is stateless.

Persistent financial state belongs to the App Platform.

Scenario calculations are initially ephemeral and MUST NOT
modify the persisted financial model unless an explicit
save/commit operation occurs.
